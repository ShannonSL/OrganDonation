# Organ Donation Campaign | Lashbrook Advertising
The main objective of this project is for teams of students to pitch, design and develop a professional advertising campaign and website for the Organ Donation Project.

For your convenience, a live version of the site can be found [here](https://shadiaali.ca/organs)

# Goal
To bring Awareness to the need for organ donors in Ontario

# How?
How?
* Social media posts with the campaign's hashtags: #RecycleYourself #WhyNotYourOrgans 
* A social event (dubbed the Recycla-ball - a play on the word 'recyclable') that will be held in 6 major Ontario cities: Toronto, Windsor, London, Hamilton, Ottawa, Niagara Falls
* Headliners for the event will be Canadian celebrities who donate a few hours of their time to party with people who have signed up to be donors and raise awareness for a good cause. Potential headliners include The Weeknd, Avril Lavigne, Justin Bieber, Billy Talent, etc.
* Promotional materials containing the url (recycleyourself.ca), a QR code which leads to the url, and our hashtags are distributed through various means: Door hanger mailers, cheeky printable invitations for people to give to their friends, a selfie wall display at service canada locations, an educational children's book, two commercials, billboards, print ads and brochures displayed at doctors offices, and stickers
* The promo materials will encourage potential donors to 1) find out more about organ donation, 2) sign up to become an organ donor
* In order to receive invitations to the Recycla-ball, potential donors must take a selfie of them signing up to donate and upload to either Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag (#recycleyourself)
* 12 people will be picked for a VIP experience - which will include a hotel, limo to the event, dinner and a meet n greet with the headliner.
* Corporate sponsorsfor the event could be very good publicity for businesses
